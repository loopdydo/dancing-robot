# dancing-robot
Music responsive servo control. 

## usage
The c files are designed for use with https://github.com/generic-beat-detector/GBD, on a raspberry pi.
The raspberry pi's io is used for servo control. The dance moves, so far, are pretty basic. But the
robot does identifiably move in time to the music, and is a real pleaser at parties (until people get sick
of me explaining how it works).
